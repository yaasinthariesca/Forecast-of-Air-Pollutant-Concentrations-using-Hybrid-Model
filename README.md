![PPT Proposal Skripsi](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00ce89a8-096a-4ac0-b61d-1f22b4ac4080)

ðŸ“Œ Created the best model that predicted air pollutant concentrations using the dataset Indeks Standar Pencemar Udara (ISPU) Jakarta from Satu Data Jakarta

ðŸ“Œ Using Python and Tensorflow Library to build a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model combined with Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) to get the best accuracy in forecasting.

ðŸ“Œ Utilized preprocessing and visualization techniques for the analysis of variables in the dataset.
