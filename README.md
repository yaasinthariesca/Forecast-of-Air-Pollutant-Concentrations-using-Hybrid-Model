Forecast of Air Pollutant Concentrations using Deep Learning Model Hybrid CNN-LSTM 


ðŸ“Œ Created the best model that predicted air pollutant concentrations using the dataset Indeks Standar Pencemar Udara (ISPU) Jakarta from Satu Data Jakarta

ðŸ“Œ Using Python and Tensorflow Library to build a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model combined with Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) to get the best accuracy in forecasting.

ðŸ“Œ Utilized preprocessing and visualization techniques for the analysis of variables in the dataset.
